## IAQ &nbsp;<sub><sup>(Infrequently asked questions)</sup></sub>

> Should I use `workspace` or `ws`?

Use `ws`. `workspace` is a binary that powers the `ws` function and sets it up in your shell configuration.

> Why do I need to add something to my shell configuration?

Otherwise workspace can't change your working directory or run commands that you specify for a workspace directly in the shell process.

> I don't trust you

That's not technically a question. But the good thing is: you don't need to. If you run `workspace shell ...` you can see what you are invoking. You can look at the code, it's all here. The binaries are built and uploaded by Travis, not me â€” 
see [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/matthias-t/workspace/blob/master/.travis.yml) and check out 
[the builds](https://travis-ci.com/matthias-t/workspace).
